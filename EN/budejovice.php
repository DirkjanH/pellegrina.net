  <p>České Budějovice (also known by its German name Budweis) was founded at
    the site of the confluence of the river Vltava (Moldau) and Mal&scaron;e
    in 1265. The historic town is still mostly in medieval state. The
    Dominican monastery stems from the 13th century. The Gothic-Renaissance
    Cern&aacute; ve&#382; (Black Tower) is with its height of 72 meter a
    striking dominant on the city skyline and offers a delightful view over
    the city and its surroundings, including the nearby Šumava mountains. On
    the diamond square one of the largest fountains of Czechia is situated -
    the Samson Fountain. The city has also become world famous thanks to the
    Budvar beer, imitated in America under the name Budweiser. Today it is
    the seat of the Province of South Bohemia. </p>

    <p>The conservatoire is equipped with spacious, well-sounding classrooms
      with well-maintained grand pianos and upright pianos. A leading
      piano tuner comes from Prague to tune all instruments before the
      course. The building has recently been renovated and now has a light
      and pleasant appearance.</p>

      town of České Budějovice has many ancient buildings, such as this
      market hall from 1336, now in use as a restaurant</div>
    <p>For those staying in the conservatory, there is a breakfast buffet in
      the entrance hall and at a nearby restaurant, where lunch is also
      served in the form of a buffet. Dinner is not included in the course
      price, except on the days of arrival and of the final concert. In
      the boarding school of the conservatory there is a kitchen in each
      corridor where you can prepare something yourself. In the nearby
      historic centre you find many good restaurants for every budget.</p>
    <p class="citaat">Laurie Boltjes: 'I always go on a long cycling tour
      after the course. Sometimes some of the other participants join me
      for a short holiday.'</p>
    <p class="citaat">Katy en Jan de Jongh: 'Before the course, we stay in
      Prague for a few days, and afterwards, we have a quiet holiday near
      the town. Bohemia is so cheap that we can afford to stay a little
      longer.' </p>
