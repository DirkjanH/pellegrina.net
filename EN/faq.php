<h2 class="begin">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul class="w3-ul w3-card-2">
  <li><B>How are chamber music ensembles put together?</B> As
    soon as we know who is going to take part in the project,
    which is usually by April, we make two sets of chamber music
    ensembles for the morning program as every player takes
    part in two different ensembles. We try to take everyone's
    wishes into account putting these groups together. Of course,
    we cannot guarantee complete satisfaction. Every participant
    may put one of these ensembles themselves. For the other
    ensemble, let us know if you have any preferences. </li>
  <li><B>The evenings are free. Is there time to
    play together? </B>Oh yes. The fanatics return to the
    monastery after dinner to play in the numerous study
    rooms. These 'night ensembles' are usually formed on
    the spot, so don't forget to bring your favorite sheet
    music. </li>
  <li><B>How should I pay?</B><em> La Pellegrina </em>offers
    two methods of payment. You may either transfer your payment
    into  account NL33 ASNB 0707 2500 72 (BIC ASNB NL21) of <em>La Pellegrina</em>, Utrecht,
    the Netherlands. 
  If this is not practical, payment in cash on the spot is also possible by mutual agreement.</li>

  <strong>How to travel to České Budějovice?</strong> International trains now run again from the Netherlands and Germany, to Linz (Austria) or Prague. From both places, there are frequent trains to České Budějovice. It is also possible to fly to Prague and take the train from there. From České Budějovice railway station, it is a 15-minute walk to the conservatoire. It is possible to have luggage collected from the station.</li>
  <li><B>How can I provide for a cancellation insurance?</B> We
    advise you to carry a cancellation insurance through your
    own bank or insurance agent.</li>
  <li><B>Is there any possibility of travelling together? </B><I>La
    Pellegrina</I> only organizes the project, not the journey.
    But you may be able to find your travel partners as a list of participants will be available after the decision about participation, <strong><?php echo $cursusdata['beslisdatum']; ?></strong>. </li>
