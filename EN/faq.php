    <h2 class="begin">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><B>How are chamber music ensembles put
            together?</B> As soon as we know who is going to take part in the
        project, which is usually by April, we make two sets of chamber music
        ensembles for the morning program as every player takes part in two
        different ensembles. We try to take everyone's wishes into account
        putting these groups together. Of course, we cannot guarantee complete
        satisfaction. Every participant may put one of these ensembles
        themselves. For the other ensemble, let us know if you have any
        preferences. </div>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><B>The evenings are free. Is there time to
            play together? </B>Oh yes. The fanatics return to the monastery or
        the conservatoire after dinner to play in the numerous study rooms.
        These 'night ensembles' are usually formed on the spot, so don't forget
        to bring your favorite sheet music. </div>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><B>How should I pay?</B> <em>La
            Pellegrina</em> offers two methods of payment. You may either
        transfer your payment into account NL33 ASNB 0707 2500 72 (BIC ASNB
        NL21) of <em>La Pellegrina</em>, Utrecht, the Netherlands. If this is
        not practical, payment in cash on the spot is also possible by mutual
        agreement. See the <a href="praktisch.php" target="_self">Prices &amp;
            Practicals page</a> for more information. </div>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><strong>How to travel to České
            Budějovice?</strong> International trains now run again from the
        Netherlands and Germany, to Linz (Austria) or Prague. From both places,
        there are frequent trains to České Budějovice. It is also possible to
        fly to Prague and take the train from there. From České Budějovice
        railway station, it is a 15-minute walk to the conservatoire. It is
        possible to have luggage collected from the station. </div>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><B>How can I provide for a cancellation
            insurance?</B> We advise you to carry a cancellation insurance
        through your own bank or insurance agent.</div>
    <div class="w3-card-2 w3-padding"><B>Is there any possibility of travelling
            together? </B><I>La Pellegrina</I> only organizes the project, not
        the journey. But you may be able to find your travel partners as a list
        of participants will be available after the decision about
        participation,
