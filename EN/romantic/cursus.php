            <h2><a name="programma"></a>The music</h2>
            <p>For 35 years, <em>La Pellegrina </em>has annually organised a
                summer course for instrumentalists and (choral) singers in
                Czechia. This course has two aspects: chamber music or chamber
                choir, and a joint programme for soloists, orchestra and choir.
                The summer school takes place in the conservatoire of České
                Budějovice. České Budějovice, also known by its German name
                Budweis, is a friendly town where the proximity to Austria is
                palpable. The conservatory has recently undergone extensive
                renovation. The concert hall has air condition, the entrance is
                spacious and bright, and the work areas have been refurbished.
                There are excellent grand pianos and fine facilities for making
                music. So anyone who would have liked to study at a
                conservatoire can still do so! In the same building there is
                accommodation in the school hostel, with simple but clean single
                and double rooms, each with its own shower and toilet. In
                addition, there is a choice of hotels in various price ranges in
                the area. </p>
            <h3>Chamber music &amp; chamber choir</h3>
            <div class="fotorechts"><img src="/Images/fluittrio.jpg"
                    alt="instrumentalists" width="500" height="334"
                    class="w3-image" /><br />
            </div>
            <p>The mornings are devoted to small ensembles. Every participant
                will be assigned to two different ensembles, alternating per
                day. At least half of the time the ensembles receive intensive
                coaching by the tutors. The ensembles will have an opportunity
                to present themselves in an internal concert.</p>
            <p class="citaat" dir="ltr">Rob Klotz: If I have to have an
                addiction, going to La Pellegrina is my drug of choice</p>
            <p>Instrumentalists take part in chamber music in all possible
                combinations of string and winds, with or without piano. All
                formations from quartet upward are possible, with perhaps a few
                incidental trios. Ensembles will be formed well in advance, so
                you can prepare your parts thoroughly at home. Very advanced
                singers (<a href="#solozang">see the description here</a>) may
                also participate in this. There is also the unique possibility
                to form larger and more complex combinations, also with winds,
                that are not easy to organize 'at home'. Think of Schubert's
                Octet, the Spohr Nonet and the Allegro for four string quartets
                by the Dutch romantic composer Van Bree.</p>
            <p class="citaat">Yo van Dijk: &quot;What I jumped into with some
                cold feet turned out to be a pleasant warm bath of enthusiastic
                musicians. For a moment you are in another world, a more
                beautiful one without worries&quot; </p>
            <p>Each morning the singers form a chamber choir and work on music
                for chamber choir, a cappella and with piano. Some singers can
                form combinations with instruments. For instance, a soprano
                could do Schubert's <em>Hirt auf dem Felsen </em>or Spohr's
                <em>Lieder </em>for voice, clarinet and piano. A baritone could
                work on Barber's <em>Dover Beach</em> with a string quartet. A
                few more suggestions: Pergolesi's <em>Stabat Mater</em> with
                strings, Mozart and Haydn <em>Lieder </em>for several voices and
                piano, Telemann's <em>Harmonischer Gottesdienst</em>, Schubert's
                <em>Hochzeitsbraten</em> or other Schubert works for several
                voices and piano, etc., etc. </p>
            <p>The course is open to individual participants as well as existing
                ensembles. </p>
            <p>There will be time for occasional combinations and musical
                get-togethers. A special evening will be the <em>Mozart Concerto
                    Event</em>, where pianists and other instrumentalists are
                invited to prepare a movement from a concerto by Mozart or a
                contemporary and the other instrumentalists are asked to
                accompany, sight-reading the orchestral parts.</p>
            <p class="citaat">Anke Muusse: “I really enjoyed my first musical
                pellegrina week because of the level of the course, the variety
                of chamber music and tutti program, the guidance by good coaches
                and the wonderful music!”</p>

                    orchestra, which is performed publicly as the conclusion of
                    the course. This year, this final concert will feature a
                    program of two works, namely the <em>Missa in tempore
                        belli</em> by Joseph Haydn for soloists, choir and
                    orchestra. In addition the orchestra is working on the
                    symphonic poem <em>The Golden Spinning Wheel</em> by Dvořák.

                    sounding České Budějovice monastery church. On the 14st of
                    June we'll slap a first coat of paint on the music, as
                    preparation for the summer, in Den Dolder near Utrecht. Of
                    course this rehearsal is not mandatory for people not living
                    in the Netherlands, but some foreign participants tend to
                    show up, combining the rehearsal with a trip or visiting
                    friends. They are of course most welcome. </p>

            <p>The course is open to 32 experienced chamber choir singers
                (SATB). The choir has a big and challenging part in de <em>Missa
                    in tempore belli</em>. In addition, the choristers form a
                chamber choir every morning and work on music by Mendelssohn,
                Dvořák, Mozart and their Czech contemporaries. Mitchell Sandler
                will lead this choir in his inimitable way, combining helpful
                vocal instructions and excellent piano accompaniment with clear
                direction. Czech professional singers, in particular tenors and
                basses, will join the choir if the balance between the various
                voice groups needs it.</p>

                    a part and would like to sing with an instrumental ensemble?
                    If so, it is possible that you will be part of one of the
                    chamber music ensembles in the morning sessions.</p>
                <p> We would like to hear you. This will give us an idea of how

                    is determined by the orchestral works: there is room for
                    double woodwinds, two horns, timpani and strings 8-8-6-6-3
                    or a few more. In the chamber music, there is room for four
                    pianists. They play in the chamber music ensembles,
                    accompany singers in their arias and may even play timpani
                    or other percussion in the orchestra, or sing in the choir.
                    For the other instruments in the orchestra, such as harp,

            <p> On Saturday, 1 June, a preliminary rehearsal day will be held in
                Den Dolder near Utrecht. Of course this rehearsal is not
                obligatory for participants from outside the Netherlands. Still,
                quite often a few participants not living in the Netherlands
                turn up, combining it with a weekend sightseeing or visiting
                friends. Mitchell Sandler and Dirkjan Horringa will lead this
                rehearsal day. Its aim is to get to know the other participants,
                and to have a first go at the choral and orchestral programme,
                so you can then prepare your part more efficiently. More
                information on the venue and times will follow. Beside that, it
                is inspiring to meet your 'chamber music colleagues' and to
                discuss the work your are going to play or sing.
