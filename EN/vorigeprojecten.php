                lightly 'hooked'. Why: 1. the balanced combination of chamber
                music and orchestra, and 2. the unrivalled Czech-musical
                atmosphere and teachers.</td>

                You meet people from all corners of the world that share your
                passion and are willing to go to the end and a bit further. And
                there are always plenty of people with whom you laugh your head
                off during breaks - yes, there are break, but not many -  or
                talk about things that concern you. And all in a wonderful
                country in which you feel in many ways like being in the 50's.

                was only two weeks ... Totally busy doing something else that
                also gave a great sense of satisfaction. A rich experience, for
                not so much money</td>
