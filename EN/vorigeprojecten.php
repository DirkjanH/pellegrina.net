You meet people from all corners of    the world that share your passion and are willing to go to the end and a bit    further. And there are always plenty of people with whom you laugh your head off    during breaks - yes, there are break, but not many -  or talk about things that concern you. And    all in a wonderful country in which you feel in many ways like being in the    50's.</p></td>
