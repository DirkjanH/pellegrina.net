<h4>List of participants, chamber music ensembles and travel information</h4>
      <p>From March 1, all information about the course, like a list of participants and chamber music schedules, can be found on the web site, at the bottom of the navigation menu. You get a login page, on which you can log in with username <strong>{login_website}</strong> and password <strong>sion</strong>.  This is to guarantee the privacy of your data.</p>
      <p>We like to  receive additional wishes and suggestions for ensemble works and  combinations and try to make them fit in. We hope to finish the list of ensemble formations by the end of April. However, please keep in  mind that this is a complicated puzzle to solve, because nobody should  be left out in either of the two sets. So it will not always be  possible to realize all wishes, however hard we try...</p>
      <p>The list of participants will also be available on the information page from March 1. The column Transport' on this list gives an indication of those who  offer a place in their car ('xx places free') and of those who would  like a place ('ride'). </p>
<h4>And furthermore... </h4>
	  <p>The instrumental parts (with  bowings) and vocal scores for the final concert will be available as PDF on the website in late April. It is advisable not just to study your part, but also to listen to the recording.</p> 
     <p>Extensive  practical information with address and telephone number, route description etc. will be sent to you by E-mail as well.</p>
