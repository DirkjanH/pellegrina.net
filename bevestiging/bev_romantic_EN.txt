<h4>List of participants, chamber music ensembles and travel information</h4>
      <p>From March 1, all information about the course, like a list of participants and chamber music schedules, can be found on the web site, at the bottom of the navigation menu. You get a login page, on which you can log in with username <strong>{login_website}</strong> and password <strong>czech</strong>.  This is to guarantee the privacy of your data.</p>
      <p>We like to  receive additional wishes and suggestions for chamber music works and  combinations and try to make them fit in. We hope to finish the list of  chamber music formations by the end of April. However, please keep in  mind that this is a complicated puzzle to solve, because nobody should  be left out in either of the two sets. So it will not always be  possible to realize all wishes, however hard we try...</p>
      <p>The list of participants will also be available on the information page from March 1.  The column Transport' on this list gives an indication of those who  offer a place in their car ('xx places free') and of those who would  like a place ('ride'). </p>
<h4>Preparatory rehearsal on June 13</h4>  
     <p>Please note: there will be an preliminary rehearsal day, held in Den Dolder near Utrecht on Saturday, June 13. Of course this rehearsal is not obligatory for participants from outside the Netherlands. Still, quite often a few participants not living in the Netherlands turn up, combining it with a weekend sightseeing or visiting friends. Mitchell Sandler and Dirkjan Horringa will lead this rehearsal day. Its aim is to get to know the other participants, and to have a first go at the choral and orchestral programme, so you can then prepare your part more efficiently. More information on the venue and times will follow. Beside that, it is inspiring to meet your 'chamber music colleagues' and to discuss the work your are going to play or sing. </p> 
<h4>And furthermore... </h4>
	  <p>Vocal scores and instrumental parts (string parts with  bowings) will be available on the website as PDF files for download in April. It is advisable not just to study your part, but also to listen to recordings of the works that will be studied.</p>
     <p>In June we will send you extensive practical information with address and telephone number, route description etc. by E-mail.</p>
