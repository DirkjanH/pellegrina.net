                    <p>Dear {voornaam},</p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you very much for sending in your application. It is a  pleasure to confirm your participation in this year's summer school. In the meantime we have received the deposit of {aanbet_bedrag} in our account. Based on your current requirements ({wensen}) the total course fee will be {cursusgeld}. You will shortly receive an invoice for this amount, which is due on
                        <strong>{datum_betaling}</strong>
                        , minus the deposit.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please keep  in mind that banks and credit card companies deduct a commission from bank transfers. All bank charges are payable by the participant.  Sending the rest of the course fee via credit card or Paypal might become rather expensive. An  option would be to bring the balance in cash. Please let me know in advance if  you intend to do so.</p>
                    <p>{opmerking}</p>
                    <p>
                        In the meanwhile, a lot of applications have been sent in, both from ‘old hands’ and from new people. But both courses still have a few open places. On our web site
                        <a href="https://www.pellegrina.net/">www.pellegrina.net</a>
                        you can find the actual situation of each course. It is in  the interest of every participant to fill up the vacancies. Suggestions or  attempts from your side to find additional instrumentalists are very welcome.  All information and the application form can still be found on the web site
                        <a href="https://www.pellegrina.net/">www.pellegrina.net</a>
                        , so please give potential  participants this link.

                    <h4>Cancellation</h4>
                    <p>
                        If
                        <em>La Pellegrina</em>
                        is unable to offer a place, or is forced to cancel a course, any fees that have been paid will be entirely refunded. Deposits cannot be refunded to applicants who withdraw from the course. Applicants cancelling after 15 June are obliged to pay the entire course fee. It is therefore advisable to take out a cancellation insurance.
                        <em>La Pellegrina</em>
                        retains the right to change tutors and programmes if such changes are considered necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reduction fund</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are very grateful for having received a number of gifts and pledges for our reduction fund. This donation will facilitate offering reductions to music students and Eastern European participants, and thus help  admitting people who are interested in the courses but unable to pay the full fee.

                    <h4>And finally...</h4>
                    <p>Please don't hesitate to call or send an email if you have any questions.</p>
                    <p>
