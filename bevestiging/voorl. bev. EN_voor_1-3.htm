                    <p>Dear {voornaam},</p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you very much for sending in your registration for the summer school. We have received the deposit of {aanbet_bedrag} in our account. In the situation that you would not be accepted, the deposit will of course be returned in full. In the situation that you are accepted you will receive an invoice. Based on your current requirements ({wensen}) the total course fee will be {cursusgeld}. At acceptance this amount, minus the deposit, is due on {datum_betaling}.</p>
                        <p>As is mentioned on the leaflet and the web site, we can only send you a definitive confirmation of acceptance on <strong>{datum_beslissing}</strong>, as we aim for well-balanced groups, taking musical abilities into account, in the interest of all participants. At the end of February we will determine who can be placed. We often have to choose from too many applicants for a particular instrument, especially for wind instruments. In this case, we primarily consider education, experience and musical insight. It is therefore important to describe your musical level well. For candidates for a particular instrument or voice type with an equivalent level, the person who applied first naturally has priority. In the event that we cannot place you, we will of course refund your deposit. If we can place you, you will receive an invoice for the course fee.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        So there is already a lot of interest, both from the 'old faithful' and from new people. But if you still know people who are interested, please refer them to the website,
                        <a href="https://www.pellegrina.net/">www.pellegrina.net</a>
                        , where all available information can be found. New people are always very welcome! Please take an occasional look yourself at this website for the latest news.

                    <h4>Cancellation</h4>
                    <p>
                        If
                        <em>La Pellegrina</em>
                        is unable to offer a place, or is forced to cancel a course, any fees that have been paid will be entirely refunded. Deposits cannot be refunded to applicants who withdraw from the course. Applicants cancelling after 15 June are obliged to pay the entire course fee. It is therefore advisable to take out a cancellation insurance.
                        <em>La Pellegrina</em>
                        retains the right to change tutors and programmes if such changes are considered necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reduction fund</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are very grateful for having received a number of gifts and pledges for our reduction fund. This donation will facilitate offering reductions to music students and Eastern European participants, and thus help  admitting people who are interested in the courses but unable to pay the full fee. Please
                        <a href="https://www.pellegrina.net/algemeen/statistics_fund.php">take a look here</a>
                        the report about last year's received contributions and granted reductions. {donatie}
                    </p>
                    <p>Please don't hesitate to call or send an email if you have any questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        With musical greetings,
                        <br>
                        on behalf of
                        <em>La Pellegrina,</em>
